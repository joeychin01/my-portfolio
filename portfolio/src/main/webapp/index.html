          My name is Joseph Chinoski, and I am a rising junior at The University of Michigan (Go Blue!).
          At UMich, I am a Computer Science Major in the College of Engineering.
          Besides coding, I play tennis, read books (especially Stephen King), and play the violin!

          Over the Coronavirus summer, I am working as a STEP intern at Google, where I am working in a pod 
          of three people to complete a capstone web development project.

          Over the summer in 2019, I participated in CSSI, a Google coding camp that is intended for incoming College 
          freshmen to learn what it is like to be a software developer, as well as to learn some coding skills revolving 
          around web development.

          At CSSI I worked in a group of three in order to build a website to help in daily life.
          Through that project, my group built the website lyric-giraffe.appspot.com, a website that 
          displays lyrics to songs, either through directly searching, or by connecting to a user's 
         Spotify account.
